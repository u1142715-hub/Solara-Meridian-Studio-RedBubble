            Designs are prepared as high-resolution masters and curated for legibility at small sizes (such as stickers and cases) while

            Redbubble product previews are visual guides. Positioning is set to keep the core focal structure clear, but minor differences
            may occur between products due to template and print-area constraints.

            Colour can vary slightly between screens and printed output due to display settings, manufacturing processes, and product materials.
            This is normal across print-on-demand production.
