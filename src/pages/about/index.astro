        <div class="section__eyebrow">Origin</div>
        <h2 class="section__title">How the studio formed</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p class="card__body" style="opacity: 0.9;">
          This isn’t an explanation of the work as much as the conditions that shaped its direction: craft, structure, and a preference for calm.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I didn’t begin as a prodigy, and I didn’t arrive at design through one defining moment.
          The path was slower—built through consistency more than talent.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          As a child, I drew the way many people do: simple sketches, small ideas. Over time that practice faded—not because creativity disappeared,
          but because it began expressing itself through other forms of making.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          That shift led me into technology. I was fascinated by systems—how structure produces outcomes, how small changes propagate,
          and how clarity and trust are created (or lost) depending on context.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I began noticing how people interpret intention under uncertainty: how meaning forms, why certain designs feel credible,
          and why others feel noisy or disposable. That attention to perception later became essential to how I approached visual work—
          as communication, not just decoration.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          After school, life took a practical direction. I entered the building industry and spent roughly two decades working as a carpenter—
          an apprenticeship in quality, material awareness, proportion, and restraint.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Over time, those principles became the foundation of the studio’s style: balanced structure, clean geometry, and surface tone used deliberately,
          not excessively. The goal is not to chase trends, but to build designs that hold up.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Solara Meridian Studio is the result: a curated body of modern symbolic designs with stone and mineral-inspired texture,
          built to feel calm and intentional across everyday products and interior settings.
