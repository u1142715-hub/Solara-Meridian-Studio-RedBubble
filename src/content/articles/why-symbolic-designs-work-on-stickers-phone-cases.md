## Small products punish weak structure

Stickers, phone cases, and small accessories reduce designs to their essentials.
Anything that relies on fine detail, edges, or novelty often collapses at this scale.

Symbolic designs hold because they:
- have a clear centre
- remain readable when cropped
- do not depend on colour trends

For long-term framing:

## Why symmetry matters on impulse items

Most small products are:
- handheld
- viewed quickly
- scanned at thumbnail size

Central symmetry ensures the design:
- reads instantly
- survives platform cropping
- feels intentional rather than accidental

This is especially important on phone cases, where framing varies by model.

## The advantage of restrained palettes

Impulse products benefit from colours that:
- do not clash with personal style
- remain neutral across outfits and interiors
- feel safe to buy without overthinking

Stone, mineral, and muted tones reduce decision friction.

## One design, many uses

When a design shares:
- consistent tone
- controlled contrast
- simple geometry

It can be used across:
- stickers
- phone cases
- tote bags
- notebooks
- small home items

This allows coordinated buying without visual noise.

## What usually fails on small products

Designs tend to struggle when they:
- rely on edge detail
- use busy patterning
- depend on trend colours
- require explanation

Symbolic structure avoids these failure points.
