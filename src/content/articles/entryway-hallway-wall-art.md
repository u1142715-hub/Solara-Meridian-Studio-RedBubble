## Small spaces amplify detail

Entryways and hallways are often narrow and transitional.
Busy art feels busier here.

Symbolic designs work well because they provide:
- one clear focal point
- structure without clutter
- texture that reads as premium at a glance

Room-fit basics:

## The first-impression rule

A hallway piece should read in seconds:
- clear centre
- controlled contrast
- enough negative space to stay calm

If the design needs explanation, it’s usually too busy for a small space.

## Why symbolism works better than decoration here

Decorative patterns often rely on repetition and detail.
Symbolic forms rely on recognition.

In narrow spaces, recognition wins.
