## The most common mistake: under-scaling

Modern interiors often have clean walls, negative space, and strong architectural lines. In that context, small art can look accidental. The fix isn’t “bigger is better”—it’s **proportion**.

A simple rule: art should look like it belongs to the room’s structure, not like an afterthought.

## Quick sizing rules (easy, not perfect)

### Above a sofa
Aim for a width that feels connected to the furniture:
- roughly **two-thirds to three-quarters** the sofa width
- or a paired set that visually reaches that width

### Above a bed
Similar logic:
- art should feel like a “header” to the bed, not a small object floating above it

### Hallways and entries
Vertical formats can add presence and make ceilings feel higher, especially with a clear focal structure.

## Single piece vs gallery set (what looks more modern)

### Single focal piece
Best for:
- calm rooms
- modern organic spaces
- “quiet luxury” styling  
It looks confident and reduces visual noise.

### Tightly composed pair
Best for:
- symmetry lovers
- Neo‑Deco and geometric styles
- spaces with strong linear architecture

### Gallery wall
Can work, but often reads busier. If you want calm premium feel, keep the set minimal and cohesive.

## How to make art feel intentional (even before you buy)

### 1) Decide the room’s “visual volume”
- Calm room: you can handle medium contrast
- Busy room: choose lower contrast, richer neutrals

### 2) Choose a stable focal structure
Centered emblems and geometric medallions read well at distance and hold up better over time.

### 3) Leave breathing space
Art looks more premium when it has space to exist. Overcrowding is the fastest way to make a room feel styled rather than lived.

## Product note (if you’re deciding between wall art and everyday items)
If you’re unsure of scale commitment, smaller formats (stickers, cases) are a low-risk way to test what palette and structure you like before committing to a wall piece.

## Trend provenance (non-clickable)
The move toward warm modernism and calmer, more intentional spaces increases the value of correct scale and proportion—art becomes a tone setter rather than decoration.
