## Neo‑Deco without the costume

Classic Deco can feel loud when copied literally. Neo‑Deco is different: clean geometry, breathing space, and selective metallic accents used as punctuation rather than glitter.

Start with the pillar: [Modern symbolic decor trends 2026–2028](../modern-symbolic-decor-trends-2026-2028/).

## Three elements that make it work

1) Geometry that breathes (spacing and symmetry)  
2) Selective metallic cues (thin highlights)  
3) Material grounding (stone + rich neutrals)  

For palette grounding: [Rich neutrals + calm geometry](../rich-neutrals-stone-geometry-2026-2028/).

## Buying tips (what keeps it modern)

- Match metals already present (brass/gold vs chrome)  
- Prefer controlled contrast to stay premium in different lighting  
- Use one anchor piece rather than multiple competing accents
