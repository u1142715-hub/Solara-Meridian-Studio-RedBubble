## Carry items are seen in motion

Tote bags and carry items are viewed while moving.
Designs need to read clearly at a distance and from different angles.

Symbolic designs perform better because they:
- stay legible while walking
- do not rely on fine detail
- feel intentional rather than decorative

## Why central structure matters on bags

Bags bend, fold, and shift.
Edge-dependent artwork often distorts or disappears.

Centered, self-contained forms ensure the design:
- remains recognisable when the bag flexes
- survives different bag sizes
- avoids awkward cropping

Carry items interact with clothing.
Highly saturated or trend colours limit usability.

Neutral, stone-inspired palettes:
- pair with more outfits
- feel calmer in daily use
- reduce hesitation at purchase

## Coordination increases repeat buying

When a tote shares a visual language with:
- phone cases
- notebooks
- desk items

Buying additional pieces feels natural.

## What usually fails on tote bags

Designs struggle when they:
- depend on edge framing
- use dense patterning
- rely on novelty slogans

Symbolic structure avoids these issues.

## Where to start

For symbolic designs built to translate cleanly onto carry items:
