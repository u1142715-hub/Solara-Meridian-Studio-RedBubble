## Tech accessories are personal and public

Phone accessories sit at the intersection of:
- personal taste
- daily visibility
- frequent use

Designs that are too loud or trend-driven create hesitation.
Neutral symbolic designs feel safer to commit to.

## Why neutrality reduces friction

Neutral palettes:
- clash with fewer cases and devices
- age better as phones change
- feel intentional rather than novelty-based

This matters for impulse purchases where confidence drives action.

## Symbolic structure survives upgrades

Phones are replaced often.
Accessories get swapped.

Designs that rely on symbolism and structure:
- remain relevant across device changes
- avoid looking dated with new hardware
- feel consistent over time

## Small tech amplifies detail

On compact surfaces:
- fine detail collapses
- edge framing fails
- busy patterns overwhelm

Centered symbolic forms maintain clarity.
