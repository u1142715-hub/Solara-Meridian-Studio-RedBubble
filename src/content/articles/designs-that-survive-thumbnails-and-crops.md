## Most buying decisions start at thumbnail size

On marketplaces, buyers rarely see full-size artwork first.
They see:
- thumbnails
- cropped previews
- small product mockups

Designs that communicate instantly at this scale convert more reliably.

## Why centered symbols win attention

Centered, self-contained forms:
- survive aggressive cropping
- remain readable at small sizes
- feel intentional rather than accidental

This is especially important on phone cases, stickers, and apparel previews.

## Complexity collapses when reduced

Fine detail and busy patterns often:
- blur at thumbnail size
- lose hierarchy
- feel noisy or random

Simple symbolic structure keeps visual order even when scaled down.

## Cropping is inevitable—design for it

Different products crop differently.
Designs that assume perfect framing tend to fail.

Robust designs:
- do not rely on edges
- keep the focal form central
- allow breathing room around the symbol

## What this means for impulse buying

When a design reads clearly at first glance:
- confidence increases
- hesitation decreases
- impulse purchases become easier

This benefits lower-cost products where speed matters.
