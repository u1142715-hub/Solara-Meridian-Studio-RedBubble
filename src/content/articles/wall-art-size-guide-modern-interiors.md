## The most common mistake: under-scaling

Modern rooms rely on negative space. In that context, small art can look accidental. The goal is proportion.

Start with the pillar: [Modern symbolic decor trends 2026–2028](../modern-symbolic-decor-trends-2026-2028/).

## Quick sizing rules (practical)

### Above a sofa
A common rule of thumb is to aim for a width that visually connects to the furniture (roughly two‑thirds to three‑quarters of the sofa width), or a pair that reaches that span together.

### Above a bed
Similar logic: the art should read as a confident header to the bed, not a small object floating above it.

### Hallways and entries
Vertical formats add presence and can make ceilings feel higher.

## Single piece vs pair vs gallery set

- Single focal piece: strongest for calm premium rooms  
- Tightly composed pair: excellent for symmetry and geometry  
- Gallery wall: works, but reads busier—keep it cohesive
