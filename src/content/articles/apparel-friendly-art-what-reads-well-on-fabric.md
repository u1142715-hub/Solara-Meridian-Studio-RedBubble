## Fabric changes how art is read

Apparel is not a flat print.
Fabric introduces movement, folds, and distance.

Designs that rely on fine detail or edge-heavy composition often fail once worn.
Symbolic designs with clear structure tend to hold.

## Why central structure matters on clothing

On apparel, designs are:
- viewed at varying distances
- distorted by movement
- cropped differently by garment type

Central, self-contained forms ensure the design:
- remains readable while moving
- feels intentional on different fits
- avoids accidental cropping

## Contrast should be controlled

High contrast can look harsh on fabric.
Low contrast can disappear.

Balanced contrast works best when:
- the focal form stays dominant
- background remains calm
- texture adds depth without noise

## Designs that scale across apparel types

Symbolic designs perform consistently on:
- t-shirts
- hoodies
- tote bags
- lightweight outerwear

When the same design language works across garments, buying feels safer.

## What usually fails on apparel

Designs struggle when they:
- rely on photographic realism
- use dense patterning
- depend on trend colours
- require precise edge framing

Symbolic geometry avoids these issues.
