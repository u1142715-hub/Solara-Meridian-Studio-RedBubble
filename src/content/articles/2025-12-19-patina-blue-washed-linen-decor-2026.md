## Why “soft luxury” is rising

A major 2026 signal is a move away from hyper-polished interiors toward **comfort-led texture** and natural variation. Linen-like softness is part of that: it reads as calm, lived-in, and premium without being loud.

Pair that texture shift with a calm blue lane (patina-like blues, muted coastal tones) and you get a palette that feels restorative rather than sterile.

## How to use calm blues without making the room cold

### Keep the base warm
Pair calm blues with:
- warm whites
- taupe, camel, and soft brown
- natural timber tones

### Prefer muted blues over bright blues
Muted blues read as “material” (aged metal, coastal haze) rather than “paint color trend.”

## What types of art pair best with this palette

- clean geometry (so the room stays calm)
- stone or linen-like texture cues
- centered focal structures (emblems/medallions)
