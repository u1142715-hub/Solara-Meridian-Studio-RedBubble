## Biophilic doesn’t have to look like “plants everywhere”

Biophilic design is often misunderstood as simply adding more greenery. The deeper idea is **sensory calm**: materials, tones, and forms that feel connected to nature and reduce mental noise.

Botanical minimalism keeps that benefit without turning a room into a theme.

## The calm botanical lane (what works in modern interiors)

### 1) One nature cue, not ten
A single botanical symbol or leaf-like structure works better than dense illustration if the room is modern.

### 2) Pair with stone and rich neutrals
Nature cues feel more premium when grounded in travertine, marble tones, and warm neutrals.

### 3) Keep structure clean
Symbolic geometry keeps botanical work from turning “crafty” or busy. It reads as modern and intentional.
