## Why travertine keeps showing up

Travertine reads warm, architectural, and grounded. It pairs naturally with timber, warm neutrals, and soft lighting. That compatibility is why it tends to persist rather than spike and disappear.

## Travertine vs marble vs quartz (quick buyer feel)

- Travertine: warm, porous, grounded  
- Marble: crisp, structured, slightly formal  
- Quartz/mineral grain: soft, serene, modern  

## How to avoid “busy stone” that looks cheap

Premium stone styling typically has:

- controlled grain (not noisy)  
- one clear focal structure (emblem/medallion)  
- restrained contrast (not harsh)  

If you want the structured metallic direction, see: [Neo‑Deco geometry](../neo-deco-geometry-modern-interiors-2026-2028/).

## Best product fits

Cases, stickers, and prints tend to benefit most because stone cues communicate material quality even at small sizes.
