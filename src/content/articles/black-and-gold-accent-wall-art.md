## Black and gold works when it is restrained

Black and gold can feel premium or chaotic.
The difference is control.

As an accent, this palette works best when it:
- anchors a space instead of dominating it
- keeps one clear focal point
- uses negative space to reduce noise

For the established style lane:

## The accent rule

Treat black and gold as a highlight, not a takeover.

A piece tends to hold better when it:
- remains readable at distance
- avoids dense patterning
- uses texture to soften contrast

## Where black and gold performs best

This palette often works well in:
- entryways and hallways
- offices and workspaces
- bedrooms with warm neutrals
- living rooms with controlled lighting

Room-fit basics:
[Wall art scale, spacing, and room fit](../wall-art-scale-spacing-room-fit/).

## What to avoid

Avoid:
- multiple competing gold highlights
- harsh micro-detail
- designs that rely on contrast alone for interest

Structure should lead; colour should support.
