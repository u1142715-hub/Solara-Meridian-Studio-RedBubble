## Why scale is the fastest way to make art feel “wrong”

Most dissatisfaction with wall art is not the design—it is **fit**.
A strong piece can look awkward if it is undersized, crowded, or placed where the room can’t support it.

Modern symbolic art works best when the room gives it **space to read**.

If you want the long-view context first, start here:

## The 3-room test (quick decision filter)

Before choosing a size, check three things:
- **Viewing distance:** will it be seen from across the room, or only up close?
- **Wall competition:** is the wall already busy (windows, shelves, frames, TV)?
- **Breathing room:** can the art sit with clear margins, not cramped between edges and objects?

If any answer creates crowding, size down the *visual complexity* (not necessarily the print size) or choose a design with stronger negative space.

## Spacing rules that keep it calm

Use these as simple constraints:
- Give the piece **clear margins** from nearby edges (corners, door frames, shelving).
- Avoid placing art where it must visually “fight” a dominant object.
- If you’re grouping pieces, keep spacing consistent and treat the group as one visual unit.

Calm interiors are created through **predictable spacing**, not constant novelty.

## What “readability” means for modern symbolic art

For symbolic geometry, readability is the entire point.
A design holds better over time when it stays clear at:
- room-distance viewing
- thumbnail-scale previews
- smaller formats (stickers, cases, apparel placement)

## Choosing art that survives room changes

Rooms change. Furniture changes. Lighting changes.
Art that lasts usually has:
- a stable focal centre
- controlled contrast (not harsh, not muddy)
- texture or depth that doesn’t rely on trend colours
- enough negative space to adapt

## Where to start

If you want “room-safe” designs with long-term fit, start with the flagship collection:
