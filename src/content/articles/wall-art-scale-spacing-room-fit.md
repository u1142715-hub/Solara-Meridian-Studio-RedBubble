## Why scale is the fastest way to make art feel wrong

Most dissatisfaction with wall art is not the design itself, but how it fits the room.
Even strong artwork can feel awkward if it is undersized, overcrowded, or forced into a space that cannot support it.

## The three checks that prevent regret

Before choosing a size, confirm:
- **Viewing distance:** Can it be read comfortably from where you usually sit or stand?
- **Wall competition:** Is the wall already busy with furniture, shelving, or screens?
- **Breathing room:** Does the art have clear margins from edges and objects?

If any answer creates crowding, reduce visual complexity rather than forcing scale.

## Readability matters more than size

Modern symbolic designs hold better when they remain clear at:
- room-distance viewing
- thumbnail previews
- smaller product formats

Geometry with controlled contrast and negative space stays legible across sizes.

Calm interiors rely on predictable spacing, not novelty.
