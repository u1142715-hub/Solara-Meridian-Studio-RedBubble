## Trends expire faster on daily-use items

Graphics tied to short-lived trends feel dated quickly, especially on items used every day.
When an item is seen repeatedly, visual fatigue accelerates.

Clean geometry lasts because it:
- relies on structure, not novelty
- remains readable as tastes shift
- feels intentional rather than reactive

## Why geometry survives scale changes

Everyday products vary widely in size and shape.
Geometric designs with clear hierarchy:
- scale predictably
- survive cropping
- remain legible in thumbnails

Related scaling logic:

## Geometry supports coordination

Geometric language is easier to repeat across products without visual noise.
This allows sets to feel cohesive rather than copied.

Coordination context:

## Trend graphics create friction

Trend-based graphics often:
- lock colour choices
- rely on novelty cues
- feel mismatched as decor evolves

This increases hesitation and reduces repeat buying.

## Where geometry performs best

Clean geometry performs consistently on:
- phone cases
- stickers
- tote bags
- desk items
- apparel

## Where to start

For restrained geometric designs built to remain relevant across products:
