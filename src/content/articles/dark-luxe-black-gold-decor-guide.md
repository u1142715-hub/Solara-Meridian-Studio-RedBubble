## Why dark luxe keeps converting

Dark palettes feel intentional when controlled. Charcoal and black can look premium and architectural—especially when paired with selective gold/brass highlights.

## Premium dark vs “too heavy” (fast checklist)

Premium dark:
- charcoal/black used as a base  
- accents used sparingly  
- clear focal structure and breathing space  

Too heavy:
- full coverage black with no relief  
- glittery metallics  
- busy detail that collapses at distance  

For geometric structure: [Neo‑Deco geometry](../neo-deco-geometry-modern-interiors-2026-2028/).

## Best product fits

Cases and prints perform well because the surface reads premium and stable; stickers work best when the emblem is clean and centered.
