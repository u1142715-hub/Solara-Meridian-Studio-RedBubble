## Bedrooms reward restraint

Bedrooms are restorative spaces.
Art that is overly busy or high-contrast can quietly increase visual stress.

Calm bedroom wall art tends to feel:
- stable rather than novel  
- textured rather than flat  
- symbolic rather than literal  

For broader context:

## The sleep-safe filter

Before choosing, check:
- Is the contrast controlled?
- Does the focal form feel stable?
- Is there enough negative space to let the eye rest?

If the answer is yes, the piece is more likely to support rest over time.

## Why texture works better than flat imagery

Texture introduces depth without demanding attention.
Stone and mineral-inspired surfaces feel grounded and calm.

## Placement matters

Even calm art can feel wrong if placed poorly.
Allow breathing room and avoid direct competition with lighting fixtures or shelving.
