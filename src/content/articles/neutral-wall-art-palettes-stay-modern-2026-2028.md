## Neutrals last when they have depth

Neutral art works because it fits more rooms.
Neutral art lasts when it has texture, structure, and warmth.

Flat neutrals often feel disposable. Textured neutrals feel intentional.

## Neutrals that tend to stay modern

Palettes that consistently age well include:
- warm stone and sand tones
- soft mineral greys
- clay, taupe, and muted earth
- restrained charcoal accents

These tones adapt easily to lighting and furniture changes.

## Why texture matters more than colour

Colour trends move quickly.
Material references move slowly.

Stone and mineral cues create depth that stays relevant even as palettes shift.

## Two neutral failure modes to avoid

Most neutral art fails by being:
1) **Too flat** — feels cheap or temporary  
2) **Too busy** — loses calm and clarity  

Strong neutral designs stay readable at both room distance and small sizes.
